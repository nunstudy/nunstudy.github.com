<!--<h3>Who is Dr. Snowdon?</h3>
<p>
    The Nun Study was started by Dr. David Snowdon. He was a Professor of
    Neurology at the University of Kentucky's College of Medicine, but has since 
	moved into part-time work.  He earned
    a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in epidemiology (i.e., the 
    study of the causes of diseases in populations). His earliest education 
    was strongly influenced by his primary teachers, who were Catholic 
    sisters. He was born in Redlands, California in 1952.

    <dt><a name="q01">What is the Nun Study?</a></dt>
    <dd>The Nun Study is a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer's disease. 
        It began in 1986 as a pilot study on aging and disability using data 
        collected from the older School Sisters of Notre Dame living in Mankato, 
        Minn. In 1990, the Nun Study was expanded to include older Notre Dames 
        living in the midwestern, eastern, and southern regions of the United 
        States. In 2008 the study returned to the University of Minnesota under
        the direction of Kelvin O. Lim, M.D.  The goal of the Nun Study is to determine the causes and prevention
        of Alzheimer's disease, other brain diseases, and the mental and physical 
    disability associated with old age.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q02">How is the study funded?</a></dt>
    <dd>The Nun Study was funded by the National Institute on Aging (one of the
        institutes within the National Institutes on Health) for 15 consecutive years. More than $2 million
        in federal tax dollars have been invested so far in this study. In 
        addition, the estate of Douglas Mohl and private foundations including the Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. and
        Helen C. Kleberg Foundation in San Antonio, Texas, have given significant 
    financial support to this endeavor.  </dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q03">When did the study begin?</a></dt>
    <dd>David Snowdon, Ph.D., and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota
        began a pilot study in 1986 using data collected from School Sisters of 
        Notre Dame living in Mankato, Minn. When Dr. Snowdon joined the College of 
        Medicine faculty at the University of Kentucky in 1990, the study was 
        expanded to include older Notre Dames throughout the United States.  The
		study returned to the University of Minnesota in late 2008.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q04">How long will the study continue?</a></dt>
    <dd>The Nun Study is an ongoing, one-of-a-kind resource for the study of 
        brain diseases in the elderly. We expect that data, tissue, and genetic 
        material collected in this study will be used by scientists for decades 
    into the future.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q05">What are the research questions?</a></dt>
    <dd>The primary research question in the Nun Study is "What factors in 
        early, mid, and late life increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and 
        other brain diseases such as stroke?" Other research questions relate to 
    the determinants of longevity and the quality of life in the elderly.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q06">Who participates in the study?</a></dt>
    <dd>Participants in the Nun Study are American Roman Catholic sisters who 
        are members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, an international religious 
        congregation that began more than 150 years ago in Bavaria, Germany. The 
        678 participants in the Nun Study were 75 to 102 years old when the study 
        began, and the average age of the participants was 83 years. Over 85 
        percent of these participants were teachers. Participants in the Nun 
        Study include women representing a wide range of function and health, 
        from sisters in their 90s who are highly functional with full-time jobs 
        to sisters in their 70s who are severely disabled, unable to communicate, 
    and bed-bound.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q07">What are the participants required to do?</a></dt>
    <dd>Each of the 678 participants in the Nun Study agreed to participate 
        in annual assessments of their cognitive and physical function, medical 
        exams, blood drawing for genetic and nutritional studies, and brain 
        donation at death for neuropathologic studies. The Nun Study represents 
        the largest brain donor population in the world. In addition, the sisters 
        have given investigators full access to their convent and medical 
    records.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q08">What gems are buried in the convent archives?</a></dt>
    <dd>The convent archives are particularly useful in our study of 
        Alzheimer's disease because they contain accurate risk factor data 
        spanning the entire lifespan of the participants. Accurate information 
        on early and mid-life risk factors is difficult or impossible to obtain 
        in most other studies on Alzheimer's disease because individuals with 
        this memory disorder cannot accurately recall their history. The convent 
        archives contain a wealth of information including baptismal records, 
        birth certificates, socioeconomic characteristics of the family, 
        education documentation, autobiographies written in early, mid, and late 
        life, as well as residential, social, and occupational data describing 
    their mid and late lives.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q09">Why study nuns?</a></dt>
    <dd>Extrapolation of findings from this unique population may be limited. 
        However, this potential disadvantage is largely offset by other advantages 
        of this population, such as the convent archives. Many factors that 
        confound (or confuse) the findings of other studies are either eliminated 
        or minimized because of the relatively homogeneous adult lifestyles and 
        environments of these women. Participants in this study are non-smokers, 
        drink little if any alcohol, have the same marital status and reproductive 
        history, have lived in similar housing, held similar jobs, and had similar 
    access to preventive and medical care.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q10">Where are the sisters?</a></dt>
    <dd>Participants in the Nun Study live in seven administrative centers of the
        School Sisters of Notre Dame located throughout the Eastern, Midwestern 
        and Southern regions of the United States. These are St. 
        Louis, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, Dallas, Mankato MN, and Wilton CT. 
        While not currently participating in this study, other sisters in this 
        congregation live throughout Eastern and Western Europe, Asia, Africa, 
    South American, and the Caribbean.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q11">Why is brain donation a requirement for participation 
    in this study?</a></dt>
    <dd>All 678 participants in the Nun Study agreed to donate their brain at 
        death to the study. The formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's
        disease is made at death by determining the
        number of Alzheimer's disease lesions (senile plaques and neurofibrillary 
        tangles) present in the cortex of the brain to cause the clinical 
        symptoms of the disease. To receive a 
        diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, participants in the Nun Study must have 
        sufficient Alzheimer's disease lesions in the brain, as well as cognitive 
        and social impairments indicative of clinical dementia. In short, we use 
        a clinical-neuropathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition 
        to diagnostic information, the brain tissue provides a rich source of 
        information on how the structure and chemical make-up of the brain may 
    provide individuals protection against brain diseases.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q12">Why do the sisters participate in this study?</a></dt>
    <dd>During the last 150 years, education has been the primary mission of
        the School Sisters of Notre Dame congregation. Sisters in this congregation 
        have spent their adult lives educating others and providing other
        services to their church and community. Most sisters enrolled in the Nun 
        Study because they believed their participation would help other women 
        throughout the world. Many felt that they could continue teaching and 
        helping others in their old age, and even after their death, by 
        participating in this study.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q13">Why don't you study men?</a></dt>
    <dd>The bulk of research in the past has been on white middle-aged men. 
        This Nun Study is unique in that it is one of a small number of 
        studies on health and aging in women, and women make up the overwhelming 
        majority of the elderly population throughout the world. We are happy 
    to focus our efforts in the study of these women.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q14">Who is conducting the Nun Study?</a></dt>
    <dd>The Nun Study is a collaborative effort between the University of 
        Minnesota and the School Sisters of Notre Dame congregation. Scientists
        from other universities also are actively collaborating with this study. In addition to many scientists and technicians, many leaders
        and health care providers of the School Sisters of Notre Dame congregation 
        have made vital contributions to this study during the last ten years. 
        Two Notre Dames, Sisters Gabriel Mary Spaeth and Marlene Manney, have 
    devoted more than five years of full-time effort to the Nun Study.</dd>
    
    <dt><a name="q15">What are you finding?</a></dt>
    <dd>We are finding that traits in early, mid, and late life have strong 
        relationships with the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the mental 
        and cognitive disabilities of old age. The study's
        publications are presented on another page of this website. Complete 
        copies of these publication can be obtained at any medical or 
    university library.</dd>
